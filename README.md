<summary><b>Task 1:</b> Task is to refer to C based and RISCV based lab videos and execute the task of compiling the C code using gcc and riscv compiler</summary>

### C Language based LAB
We have to follow the given steps to compile any **.c** file in our machine:  
1. Open the bash terminal and locate to the directory where you want to create your file. Then run the following command:

	```
	gedit sum.c
	```  
2. This will open the editor and allows you to write into the file that you have created. You have to write the C code of printing the sum of n numbers. Once you are done with your code, press ```Ctrl + S``` to save your file, and then press ```Ctrl + W``` to close the editor.   
3. To the C code on your terminal, run the following command:

	```
	gcc sum.c
	./a.out
	```

### RISCV based LAB
We have to do the same compilation of our code but this time using RISCV gcc compiler. Follow the given steps:  
1. Open the terminal and run the given command:  

	```
	cat sum.c
	```
### Cat Command:

</p>

2. Using the **cat** command, the entire C code will be displayed on the terminal. Now run the following command to compile the code in riscv64 gcc compiler:  

	```
	riscv64-unknown-elf-gcc -O1 -mabi=lp64 -march=rv64i -o sum.o sum.c
	```
3. Open a new terminal and run the given command:    

	```
	riscv64-unknown-elf-objdump -d sum.o
	```
### Objdump using -O1 format:

</p>

4. Open the previous tab and run the following command to compile the code in riscv64 gcc compiler:  

	```
	riscv64-unknown-elf-gcc -Ofast -mabi=lp64 -march=rv64i -o sum.o sum.c
	```

5. Open a new terminal and run the given command:    

	```
	riscv64-unknown-elf-objdump -d sum.o
	```
### Objdump using -Ofast format:
